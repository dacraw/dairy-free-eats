Order #<%= @order.id %> is now being "prepared", aka it has been set to active.
=======================================

Items Ordered:
    
<% @line_items.map do |item| %>
    <%= item["name"] %> x<%= item["quantity"] %>
<% end %>
=======================================

You may, if you'd like to, of course, return back to the Admin Dashboard to set the order to "In Transit" to continue with the demo!

Please note that this is only a demo, no food will actually be delivered to you. :)
